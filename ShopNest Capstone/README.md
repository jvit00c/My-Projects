	I have built a simple, single-sheet dashboard using Power BI for ShopNest, a leading departmental store in Portugal’s e-commerce market. The platform connects small businesses from various regions across Portugal, streamlining operations through a single point of contact.
	This dashboard provides an in-depth and interactive analysis of delayed orders, frequently used payment types, seasonal sales patterns, monthly comparisons between delayed and on-time orders, revenue analysis, state-wise sales, top product category sales, and the best and worst reviewed products. It also highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, total price, total sales, and average order value (AOV). Let us Breakdown the dashboard and understand the analysis that went into each visual chart.

Detailed explanation on each visualization metric is in attached Dashboard Report document, I have not attached the power BI file as it was exceeding 25mb
